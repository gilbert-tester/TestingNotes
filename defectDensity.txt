Defect Density
Defect density can be defined as the number of confirmed bugs in a software application or module during the period of development, divided by the size of the software. Defect density is counted per thousand lines of code, also known as KLOC.
Defect Density = Defect count/size of the release
USES
 - For comparing the relative number of defects in various software components so that high-risk components can be identified and resources focused on them.
 - For comparing software/products so that the quality of each software/product can be quantified and resources focused towards those with low quality
