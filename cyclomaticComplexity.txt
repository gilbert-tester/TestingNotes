Cyclomatic complexity - It is the measure of the number of independent paths in an application or program. This metric provides an indication of the amount of effort required to test complete functionality.
Consider for example a code with no if-else statements. Since the entire code always executes i.e. only one decision point, the Cyclomatic complexity of the program is 1. If there is one if-else statement, the code can only execute one of those blocks and never both. Because there are two decision points, the complexity of this code is 2.
Complex code is always difficult to maintain and modify and test. So it is good to keep the CC no low
