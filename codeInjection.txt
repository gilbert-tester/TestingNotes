Code Injection
Code Injection is the general term for attack types which consist of injecting code that is then interpreted/executed by the application. This type of attack exploits the poor handling of untrusted data. These types of attacks are usually made possible due to a lack of proper input/output data validation, for example:
allowed characters (standard regular expressions classes or custom)
data format
amount of expected data
