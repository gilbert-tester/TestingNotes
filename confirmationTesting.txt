Confirmation Testing
Confirmation testing is also known as re-testing. Confirmation Testing is done to make sure that the tests cases which failed in last execution are passing after the defects against those failures are fixed.
For Example: Suppose you were testing some software application and you found some defect
1. You log a defect in the bug tracking tool
2. Developer fixes the defect and provides you with the official testable build
3. You need to re-run the failed test cases to make sure that the previous failures are gone
This is known as confirmation Testing or Re-testing
